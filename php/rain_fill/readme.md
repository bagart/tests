In Fig. 1, we have walls of different heights. Such pictures are represented by an array of integers, where the value at each index is the height of the wall. Fig. 1 is represented with an array as [2,5,1,2,3,4,7,7,6].

Now imagine it rains. How much water is going to be accumulated in puddles between walls? For example, if it rains in Fig 1, the following puddle will be formed:

No puddles are formed at edges of the wall, water is considered to simply run off the edge.

We count volume in square blocks of 1Ã—1. Thus, we are left with a puddle between column 1 and column 6 and the volume is 10.

Write a program to return the volume for any array.
